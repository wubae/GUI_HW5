# HW5 GUI

Link: https://wubae.github.io/HW5/

This is a website that emulates the popular "Scrabble" game.

You can drag and drop the Scrabble squares.

The website keeps track with the score, properly tallied accounting the bonus square multipliers.

Any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles.

After playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring back to 7 tiles are selected.

There is a next button that acts as an validator for the word and transitions to the next round.

Tiles can only be dragged from the rack to the board. If the user drops the tile anywhere else, the tile will be
bounced back to the rack.

Once the tile is placed on the board, it can be moved back to the rack.

Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below another letter with no space.

A user can always choose to restart the game.
